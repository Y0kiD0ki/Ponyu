# Ponyu
A game I made with a friend for a high school coding project during junior year.
If the game has any issues, I'm sorry. It's the first game I made and it shows.

___HOW TO RUN___
All you got to do is run the finalversion_huang.py.
Make sure Python and Pygame are installed.

___LORE (in case you ever wanted to know)___
Ponyu, the titular blue slime, infiltrates a Taco Bell one night to get some Cinnabons. Suddenly, he discovers a trap door in the kitchen and decides to investigate. What secrets will Ponyu find in this Taco Bell?

__GAMEPLAY (because there are no instructions)__
1. Move with WASD
2. Shoot slime balls with SPACE
3. Get 100 Cinnabons (aka hit the Craneo Fuegos 100 times)
4. If you get hit, you lose some Cinnabons but it's okay because you don't have lives
5. If you die and are floating in mid-air, just hit D to go down back to the "floor"
